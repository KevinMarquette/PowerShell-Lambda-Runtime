## Downloading PowerShell
Download PowerShell from `https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases` and extract content to `./layer/powershell`. You should have `pwsh` located at `./layer/powershell/pwsh` when you unzip it. Make sure you get a `linux-x64.tar.gz` package because it needs to execute in the lambda. I used [powershell-7.0.1-linux-x64.tar.gz](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.0.1/powershell-7.0.1-linux-x64.tar.gz) while developing this custom runtime.
